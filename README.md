# Object_Detection
This project performs real-time object detection using the YOLOv3 model with OpenCV in Python. It processes video input (from file or webcam), detects objects using pre-trained weights on the COCO dataset, and displays bounding boxes with class labels. The YOLO model is loaded using OpenCVâ€™s DNN module, and Non-Maximum Suppression is used to remove overlapping detections. Each detected object is shown with a colored box and label on the video frame.
## Features
- Real-time object detection
- Supports custom videos or webcam
- Basic YOLOv8 integration
- Visualization of detection results with bounding boxes

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pre-trained YOLOv8
